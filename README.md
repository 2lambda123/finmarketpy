# pythalesians

pythalesians is a Python financial library developed by the Thalesians (http://www.thalesians.com). Whilst elements of the project will remain proprietary, we are keen to publish many of the elements to the community.

The Thalesians are a think tank of dedicated professionals with an interest in quantitative finance, economics, mathematics, physics and computer science, not necessarily in that order.
